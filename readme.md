# 🧮 Standard Unit Converter – Python Tkinter Project

This is a simple **GUI-based Unit Converter** application built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library. It allows users to convert between different units of length, weight, volume, area, and temperature.

## 🚀 Features

- Convert between:
  - Length units (meter, kilometer, foot, inch, etc.)
  - Weight units (gram, kilogram, ton, pound, etc.)
  - Volume units (litre, millilitre, gallon, etc.)
  - Area units (square meter, acre, etc.)
  - Temperature (Celsius ⇄ Fahrenheit)
- Simple and intuitive GUI
- Input validation and error handling
- Reset button to clear fields and start over

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** for GUI components

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

1. Make sure Python is installed (`python --version`)
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python unitConverter.py
📚 What I Learned
Through this project, I developed practical skills in the following areas:

✅ Python Programming
Using built-in data types like dict, list, and float

Writing functions with error handling using try/except

✅ GUI Development
Creating windows, frames, labels, buttons, and input fields using Tkinter

Handling user interaction with StringVar, OptionMenu, and event-driven callbacks

Structuring a GUI layout using grid() and pack()

✅ Logic & Validation
Handling unit compatibility (e.g., not converting "celsius" to "kilogram")

Validating user input to prevent crashes

Building reusable structures like a unit dictionary (unitDict) and unit categories (length_units, weight_units, etc.)

✅ Debugging & Problem-Solving
Tracking down logical and scoping errors (UnboundLocalError, etc.)

Fixing mismatched variable names, typos, and GUI bugs
